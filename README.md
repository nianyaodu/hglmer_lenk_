# Bayesian Inference for Finite Mixtures of GLMs with Random Effects

This repository provides code implementing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the Bayesian hierarchical random effects model proposed in the following paper:

Peter J. Lenk and Wayne S. Desarbo (2000), "Bayesian Inference for Finite Mixtures of Generalized Linear Models with Random Effects." *Psychometrika*

Please refer to the `Readme.txt` file for the detailed instructions on running the code.
